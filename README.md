“Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will, in the end, contribute most to real wealth, good morals, and happiness.” 

The Agriculture sector in India contributes only 17% of GDP at current prices. In spite of the recent advancements in technological trends, agriculturalists are far behind to avail those resources because of the mere educational background and sly middlemen. Due to their inability to predict the disease present in the crops early, they are not able to yield good quality crops while harvesting. According to a survey, the sector would witness a growth of 2.1% by 2020 and would lead to an increase in the farmer’s income. This could be fast-tracked by automation and other technologies. 

 In order to address this issue effectively, we propose to create a web-app which acts as a single platform wherein we provide the farmer with recent government policies and schemes. Our aim is to revolutionize the market trend where we attempt TO ERADICATE THE CONCEPT OF MIDDLEMEN who seize the profits leaving the farmers with so little. The state of the farmers is in tatters. We, in our project, provide a platform(Web-app) which allows THE DIRECT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BUYER AND FARMER.
 
As a contributing factor to the Nation’s good, we endeavor to provide help to these farmers. The Front-end of the Application would be made using Angular or React. It would be the FUSION OF SOCIAL-NETWORKING SITE AND E-COMMERCE SITE for the agriculturist. We have incorporated an efficient DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM,  to predict the disease of crops so that early measures could be taken. We have proposed a system which not only enriches farmers but also eases their trade with a convenient User Interface.
We have constructed every page after a through survey and analysis of farmer’s requirements with at most accuracy through a apparent User Interface. We have built this application with one of the most powerful languages (React) as it provides excellent rendering services dynamically and handles traffic with very high precision level. The modules built in this application are
* News Feed 
* Online Trading of goods
* Disease Identifier
This project is done using REACT NATIVE, Google DialogFlow. The News Page is brought to you using NEWS API.
